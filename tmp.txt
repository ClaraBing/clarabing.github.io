I am a first-year PhD student at the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. 

Previously, I was a CS master's student at Stanfordi, where I was extremely fortunate to work on the
 video and healthcare team in the Stanford Vision and Learning Lab under the supervision of Prof. Li Fei-Fei and Dr. Juan Carlos Niebles.

I am really interested in video understanding and would like to build video understanding models that are reliable, efficient and versatile enough for real-world applications. I am currently applying to PhD programs, where I can get more in-depth studies on representation learning, data efficiency, interpretability and reasoning.



rle_obj = segms[t][c][i]
if type(rle_obj['counts']) == np.ndarray:
  # format of our masks: 'counts' are the 4 coordinates of a bbox
  xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax = rle_obj['counts']
  m = np.zeros((H, W))
  m[xmin:xmax+1, ymin:ymax] = 1
else:
  # format of the provided mask (in coco format): 'counts' is a byte string
  m = maskUtils.decode(rle_obj)  # Python COCO API
